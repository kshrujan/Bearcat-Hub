					<p class ="aboutTab">Tired of staring at your old textbooks just sitting around in your room? Maybe you have an old fridge you no longer have use for. Bearcat Hub was designed with this problem in mind. Hub offers Willamette students and faculty a "Marketplace" style service where users can buy and sell items. How is this any different from using other sites like craigslist? The main distinction is that Bearcat Hub is designed with WU in mind, which means that only those with a valid Willamette email account can use the service. This provides you, the user, with a safer alternative to services offered by other sites. What else can Hub do for you? Hub also seeks to offer services such as Tide, a live Willamette newsfeed, and Get a Ride, which is a rideshare service aimed at building connections with those in the Willamette community.</p>
